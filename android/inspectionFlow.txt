Communication Flow During an Active Inspection
note: end of description in parenthesis is the command information (source->destination COMMAND USED)
      D = drone. P = phone.

// initial setup
  establish bluetooth connection, success known once status updates are being received (D->P STATUS)
  phone sends initial user plotted boundary to drone (P->D NEW_HOUSE)
  drone sends calculated flight path back to phone (D->P SEND_PATH)

// begin aerial scan phase
  user initiates inspection, phone lets drone know to start inspection (P->D START_INSPECTION)
  drone sends signal confirming that it received the start inspection signal (D->P START_INSPECTION)
  drone begins circumnavigating, border followed by roof
  drone lets phone know that circumnavigation is complete (D->P FINISHED_SCAN)
  drone returns home and lands (D->P DRONE_LANDED)

// aerial scan phase complete, user confirmation & salting phase
  drone notifies phone that it's analyzing images and marking potential icedams (D->P START_ANALYSIS)
  drone sends list of the potential icedam images it will be sending to phone (D->P SEND_JSON_RGB)
  drone sends the potential icedam images with corresponding points to phone (D->P SEND_IMAGES_RGB)
  phone plots points and displays images to user
  user confirms which points are icedams, phone sends those points back to drone (P->D SEND_ICEDAM_POINTS)
LOOP:
  THIS drone places salt at icedam location (D->P FINISHED_DAM)
    OR drone placed salt at final icedam location, END, after landing (D->P FINISHED_ALL_DAMS)
  drone returns home and lands (D->P DRONE_LANDED)
  phone sends continue signal, LOOP (P->D CONTINUE)
  phone sends end inspection signal, END (P->D END_INSPECTION) 

// salting phase complete, image transfer phase
END:
  let drone know i want images (P->D SEND_IMAGES_RGB)
  drone sends list of rgb images it will be sending to phone (D->P SEND_JSON_RGB)
  drone sends rgb images to phone (D->P SEND_IMAGES_RGB)
  i want images therm (P->D SEND_IMAGES_THERM)
  drone sends list of thermal images it will be sending to phone (D->P SEND_JSON_THERM)
  drone sends thermal images to phone (D->P SEND_IMAGES_THERM)

// image transfer phase complete, power down
  power down??


asychronous signals:
  D->P LOW_BATTERY
  D->P BORDER_SCAN_INTERRUPTED (comes with a low battery signal)
  D->P ROOF_SCAN_INTERRUPTED (comes with a low battery signal)
